### Infrastructure

    * Countermeasures protect from attackers

    * Servers - The more servers you have, the more users you can support

    * Databases - Databases turn data into (points)

    * Websites - Users only visit websites that have what they want

    * Services - Give you a specific edge

### Actors

    * Users - Require server space, result in data and money

    * Employees - Build your infrastructure

### Setup

There's a bag with 32 white cubes and 6 red/blue/yellow cubes for 48 total cubes

Each player receives a player board. Each players receives $5 and a CEO employee card

Shuffle the infrastructure tiles, users and employees.

Fill each purchasing space on the board with a infrastructure tile.

##Each round:

The game is played over 5 rounds. Each turn players will be able to hire employees,
buy infrastructure tiles, and get users.

    Planning
        - Each player draws 3 employee cards and keeps 1.

    Build out:
        - Starting with the first player
            - Buy an infrastructure tile
                - Exhausting employee(s) equal to the tech/business value
                - Pay $ equal to the position on the track, minus $ of the used employees
            - After a tile is purchased, all tiles slide right one space
            - Any empty spaces on the track are refilled from the top of the deck

    Launch:
        - Starting with the website with the highest value, choose a user card to take
            - You may a total number users with a user value less than / equal to your servers
            - You must having matching icons on your website to take a user card (can be reused)
            - After a user is taken, refill from the top of the deck
        - Pay for any server you have used

    Income:
        - Gain money from each customer
        - Draw cubes from the bag equal to the data value on all acquired users
        - Colored cubes are malicious data. While cubes are good data.
        - Discard a matching colored cube for each firewall/antivirus/load balancer
        - Good data can be used in databases or services to score points or active abilities

    Payday
        - Return all cubes to the bag
        - Unexhaust each of your employees
        - Pay each of your employees their salary or discard them

### TODO
- What does malicious data do? Invalidate a specific type of hardware for a turn? Cost money/employees?
